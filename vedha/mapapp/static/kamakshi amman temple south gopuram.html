  <h1>Kamakshi Amman Temple</h1>

  <p>
    The Kamakshi Amman Temple, located in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu, is a major 
    Hindu shrine dedicated to Goddess Kamakshi, a form of Parvati. The temple 
    dates back to the Pallava period and was later enhanced by Chola and 
    Vijayanagara kings.
  </p>

  <p>
    Known for its classic Dravidian architecture, the temple features a sacred 
    sanctum where the goddess sits in a unique posture holding a sugarcane bow 
    and flower arrows. Its gopurams, especially the South Gopuram, showcase 
    beautiful carvings and traditional craftsmanship.
  </p>

  <p>
    The temple is one of the most important Shakti places of worship and remains 
    a vibrant center of festivals, rituals, and devotion.
