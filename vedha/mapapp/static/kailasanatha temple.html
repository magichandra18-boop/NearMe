  <h1>Kailasanatha (Kailasa) Temple</h1>

  <p>
    The Kailasanatha Temple, also called the Kailasa Temple, is one of India’s most remarkable 
    architectural achievements. Located at the Ellora Caves in Maharashtra, it was built in the 
    8th century by the Rashtrakuta dynasty.
  </p>

  <p>
    What makes this temple unique is that it was carved entirely from a single rock using a 
    top-down technique. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, it symbolizes Mount Kailash and features 
    detailed carvings, a Nandi Mandapa, tall pillars, and sculptures from the Ramayana and 
    Mahabharata.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, the Kailasa Temple is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site at Ellora and is 
    admired for its scale, beauty, and engineering brilliance.
